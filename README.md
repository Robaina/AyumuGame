Inspired by the memory games that Chimp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumu_(chimpanzee)">Ayumu</a> plays in the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University. So far, only one game is implemented. Once you click or touch on the ring-shaped button, the rest of the numbers will get hidden. Your goal is to select then all in the correct order (sorry no apples delivered). Ayumu can do this by viewing the numbers during only 0.5 seconds! Here you can take as long as you can to memorize the positions!

Watch Ayumu in action!
